Note that the guide is based on an older version of react:

1) In app.js, change '<Switch>' to '<Routes>', see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71013851/i-am-coming-across-switch-export-error-from-react-router-dom
2) In app.js, change 'component=' to 'element=' with additional formatting, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69854011/matched-leaf-route-at-location-does-not-have-an-element
3) Labels are missing in PersonForm for each FormGroup, be sure to include those.
